# 64_Bit_Hardware_Locked_RV32I_Processor

This is a 32 bit single cycle RiscV Processor with limited instructions. Aim of the project was not to build a RV32I but to logic lock the processor.
This is a basic version first pushed on 09.29.2024.
Further updates to the processor's pipelining, instruction set and the locking techniques will be appended or generated as a new repository in my profile.
Thank you.
